# summary
after finishing the one month pratical buildup course,i do have some new experience and indeed learn a lot.

which could be conclude into two parts,one is about programing lanuage java and the other is about the accutual work of our future job requires.

1. about the java programing language,i am getting why java will become the most used language by far,one part is because it is indeed a good oop language compared with c++,python,javascript. to be specific is that although it doesnt support multi inherit but the interface and superclass design is good enough and its just a simple design pattern choice.

    personal opinion about these problem is that provied some limit in the program language aspect is not that bad.just like although you can code freely with any style with javascript but after a while you will find the code turn out to be very misreadable,that's because the language didnt provide you with the coding style.

    and other thing i learned about java is that although light-weight language is prefered by more and more coder,like python,and you actually will be enjoying by coding this light-weighted language,but when you accustomed to the language which is not that light-weight but provided as many functionality you want by make them insert into the build-in class.the experience is not that bad.you can actually code a little bit fast and the rubustness of you code can be really improved thanks to the static type checking.

    and the best thing about java is that its perfect to build a large program,which means like the actually commercial program,thanks to its design about .class and the file structure.and to maintain this code can be very easy.

2. the second part is about this one month course.

    from my perspective,the main purpose of this course is to show us how is the job will be like in real company.although i didnt know how exactly the real company works,but one thing is clear,there's not much flexiblity for the coder to code the creative code when they in the middle of the software level program.the most time they can do is to make use of the code others wrtite or just simply use framework.

    to me its kind of boring to do this kind of job,because the only motivation for me to keep going in the way of computer is to do something new,to make use of my talent,doing this none-creative job just simply not my thing.

    so i guess that might be the biggest experience learn from this course. to make me realize how the work will be to in a company.

3. the last part i want to talk about the detail of me working with these task provided by the course.
    1. so the first week is kind of the most diffcult one for me. it might because that dealing with the enviorment will be kind of twisted, but also that to work with a completely new language.

        i would say that thanks to my prepare for java help me deal with the first week.i have to say that head first java is a fine book, use life example to help reader to familar with the main content of java.
    2. the task on the second week is kind of easier because all you need to do is to doing some adjustment of the current code,clearly you dont need to put much thoughts into this.so i done such thing before friday and the weekend becomes really happy for me compare to the the last week.
    3. the last week,or to be say, this week,the task i thought as easy as the second week,because all you need to do is to do a minor adjustment of current code provided by the github page,and that's over,how good is that.

so final conclusion about myself to the course is that,the course do give me a new experience about coding in real life,and that's good,and the level of diffcult is fine considering to all the students,and time is fine i am not rushing actually,and if i have to score this course i will give a 8 out of 10.
